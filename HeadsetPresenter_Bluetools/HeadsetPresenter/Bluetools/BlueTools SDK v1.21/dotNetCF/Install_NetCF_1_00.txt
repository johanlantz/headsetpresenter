Native DLLs BlueTools.dll, BlueToolsMS.dll, BlueToolsWC.dll and BlueToolsWC150.dll should be placed 
in the same directory as your application EXE or under \Windows.

You find the native DLLs under wince420\ for each processor. If there are no DLLs for your processor, please
contact support@franson.com

Or use the CAB files to install all native DLLs above under \Windows.
