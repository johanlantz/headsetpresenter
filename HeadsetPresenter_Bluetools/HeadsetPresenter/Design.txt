Pushkeys observations
1. The window handling does not seem to affect flickering at all.
2. If VK is replaced with normal keys for instance VK_N -> n it seems as the flicker stops
3. The DLL lib seems faster then the standard pushkeys.
4. keyb_event has been deprecated, try SetInput if problem persists

Design of string sent to database:
Spaces can occur in headset or dongle names << are unlikely to appear though:
Only issue is lenght of QueryString but I think that is more then 2000 chars.
--------------
[tag1]:=<<value>> [tag2]:=<<value2>> 
example 
ver:=<<3.0>> stack:=<<1>> hsname:=<<Jabra 135>> donglename:=<<Generic Bluetooth device>>
--------------------

AVRCP skickar connection_req om bara hs är pairat med datorn, ingen länk verkar behövas innan 
men jag antar att det går snabbare om det finns tex en headset länk uppe.

Issue: CoInitialize must be called from the same thread as OnReadComplete
Solution: myPPProxy is created immidiatly by CHeadsetPresenterDlg but it is started by
the CommandCallback routine that is called by OnReadComplete. By doing that CoInitialize is 
called only once and by the OnReadComplete thread. We need CoInit both for licensemanager and 
for the ppControl

ppControl may have been created without CreateLicenseManagerProxyAndCheckLicense()
have beeing called, therefor ppControl should always be deleted by the proxy BUT
we must check if we should delete myLicManProxy
If no commands has been sent to HeadsetPresenterDlg->CommandCallback, the proxy is only created not started.

Issue;
Sometimes when pressing VGS button on HS the VGS=7 command is not taken care of befoer the next
VGS command is sent, for instance:

AG                  HS
					Initially at VGS=7
VGS=9   <-
		->			VGS=7  this is not handled until after VGS=11 has gone away
VGS=11	<-
VGS=9	<-			Here VGS=7 is set in HS but now 9 < 11 and we move backward when we should move forward

So lastVGS = newVGS does not work unless we can guarantee that each VGS from AG is processed before
the next VGS leaves the HS. This cannot be done.

Proposed solution:
If Handsfree profile:
In HFP we can use the +VGS from AG, solve the speed problem by always comparing with 7
if newVGS > 7 then forward
else backward

Then we have all numbers [8,15] for forward, VGS=7 is always sent but we can send atleast 4 VGS 
before the +VGS=7 must kick in.

Problem for HFP
If the HS does not support +VGS from AG this will not work, must be checked by the wizard

Solution:
If AG VGS is not supported and repeat of VGS=15 does not work then forward only mode must be used. 
Wizard must support this for HFP:

WIZARD behaivour:
Hands-Free
1. Is VGS=15 repeated -> All fine do not send +VGS=7 from AG comapre with lastVGS
2. VGS=15 is not repeated but +VGS=7 works. -> Use VGS=7 and compare with <>7 
3. VGS=15 is not supported, +VGS=7 does not work but VGS commands arrive. -> Use forward only mode
4. No VGS commands. -> Use Headset profile

Headset
1. Is VGS=15 repeated -> All fine do not send +VGS=7 from AG comapare with lastVGS
2. VGS=15 is not repeated but +VGS=7 works. -> Use VGS=7 and compare with <>7 
3. VGS=15 is not supported, +VGS=7 does not work but VGS commands arrive. -> Use forward only mode
4. No VGS commands. -> Use CKPD command
